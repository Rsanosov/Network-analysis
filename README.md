# Network-analysis
This is the project "Ego Network Analysis" for course "Network Science" of Data Science Master Program at HSE (Moscow, Russia). 
On this project, i analyse my ego graph (it is the graph of connections beetween my friends without me) on the social network Vk. Vk api using to download information about my friends. <p>
My ego network consists 75 friends and 349 connections and 2 connetions components. <p>
The report consists of 3 parts: <p>
First part consists graph summary (graph characteristics, compare distribution with different real-world models). <p>
Second part consists structural analysis (degree, closeness, betweenness centralities, PageRank, Assortative Mixing, Node Structural Equivalence, finding Closest Random Graph). <p>
Third part consists community detection (Clique Search, K-core decomposition, detection by Laplacian Eigenmaps, Agglomerative clustering, async update labels). <p>
In this repository you could find project code with explanations, network file and asumption about communities (csv file with name of the nodes and label of communities). <p>
